                    <p>Allen Solly is the best choice, but I have a suggestion for manufacturers please make proper fitting on "Sleeves" for "Medium Size" people because we don't have much long enough arms. There is 4" inches extra long Sleeves. Almost fitting is perfect and the finishing is so fine I can feel it totally. ❤️✌️</p>
